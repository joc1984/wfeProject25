            <p>The DANA in Valencia has once again highlighted the importance of real-time fact-checking. An undertaking that is more aspirational than feasible, given the speed of dissemination of information on social networks, which is viral and immediate.
            </p>
            <p>Alvise Perez, an MEP with over 1M followers on Instagram, posted a video denouncing the alleged dumping of tons of donations by the State in what he titled “the biggest scandal since the beginning of DANA”. The content calls for outrage and generates the desired reaction: it is the post with the highest engagement in the last 30 days. A day later, several media outlets deny this claim, but the damage has already been done. The content goes viral, the message passes and verification arrives late and with much less force. Regional newspapers lose the battle against this media Goliath.</p>
            <p>In the same week Isaac Belk, who has 6M followers on TikTok, put the spotlight on the work of NGOs, calling for “not leaving a turd on any collection site run by any organization”. In the same vein, we've all heard at some point - from the mouth of someone who doesn't even bother to corroborate it - that NGOs “keep the money.” This kind of statement discredits the work of these organizations and has a direct impact on the victims.</p>
            <p>Journalists, media and other sources based on contrasted facts will always be one step behind the lie, the relative truth, the hoax. Although fact checking mechanisms exist, applying them means spending time, money and resources. As a consequence, the contrasted fact appears late, when attention has already been diverted to another subject. The truth is the coyote swallowing dust, trampled and humiliated by a roadrunner he will never catch.</p>
            <p>If truth is condemned to take a back seat and no institution instructs us, it falls upon us to acquire the tools that will allow us to slow down the assimilation of information we receive through the four screens. Just as we question the discourse of the media, which we label as partisan, every opinion shared through social networks is also a political act. If we look beyond the content and focus on the continent, the intentionality is even clearer.</p>
            <p>This is an exercise that I always practice: when someone I know sends any content with reactionary overtones - the kind that the recommendation algorithms like so much -, I go to see the account that published it. Another approach is to focus on the comments - which are always more of a discussion than a dialogue - to capture the positioning of the target audience. The result: content generated to increase the reach (influence) of an account (person or entity) and its metrics (authority, credibility).</p>
            <p>Coincidences of life, a week later Donald Trump is once again proclaimed president of the most powerful nation on earth, whose policies affect the economic and social situation of the rest of the nations. His way of communicating, imitated by millions of users, sacrifices ethics for metrics, mortally wounding one of the pillars of democracy: truth.</p>
            <p>In this world intoxicated by lies, the fronts have multiplied. Where there used to be a small number of discourses that benefited a small number of interest groups transmitted through the mass media, today there are incalculable points of view, identities and realities, as singular as each individual with access to the Internet. This turns the world into a powder keg, where a single fuse can set off a chain reaction that claims lives, demonizes minorities and segregates families by depriving them of any element of communion.</p>
            <p>Whoever sees these disparities and puts them to work for himself will be the master of the world.</p>
