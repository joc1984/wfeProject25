            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in late 2019 and swept across the globe through 2020 and beyond, did more than challenge health systems and economies — it also triggered an unprecedented wave of misinformation. As the virus spread, so too did a parallel “infodemic,” a term coined by the World Health Organization to describe the flood of fake news and misleading content that complicated the global response to the crisis.</p>
            <p>From the earliest days of the outbreak, social media platforms and private messaging apps became breeding grounds for conspiracy theories, pseudoscientific cures, and dangerous health advice. Among the most widespread myths was the false claim that COVID-19 was created in a lab as a bioweapon — a narrative that gained traction despite lacking solid scientific evidence and being denied by leading virologists.</p>
            <p>Other misinformation took a more immediate toll on public health. Some posts falsely suggested that drinking bleach, consuming large amounts of garlic, or inhaling steam could prevent or cure the virus. These claims, although repeatedly debunked by health authorities, led to several cases of poisoning and hospitalizations in different countries.</p>
            <p>Vaccines became a prime target for disinformation once they were developed. Anti-vaccine movements, which had long existed in fringe communities, gained unprecedented visibility. Fake news stories claimed that COVID-19 vaccines contained microchips, altered DNA, or were part of a population control scheme. These narratives contributed to vaccine hesitancy and resistance, particularly in vulnerable and underserved communities.</p>
            <p>Governments and international institutions struggled to keep up. Although fact-checking organizations and social media platforms implemented measures to label or remove false content, the sheer volume of disinformation overwhelmed many efforts. Meanwhile, some political figures and celebrities contributed to the confusion by spreading unverified or misleading statements themselves.</p>
            <p>Dr. Maria Santos, a public health expert in Madrid, emphasized the challenge: “In a pandemic, trust in science and institutions is critical. When that trust is undermined by misinformation, the consequences can be fatal.”</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 infodemic exposed weaknesses not just in public health systems, but in digital communication infrastructure. It revealed how quickly false narratives can spread, how hard they are to reverse, and how essential it is to strengthen digital literacy, promote critical thinking, and build transparent communication from trusted sources.</p>
            <p>As the world continues to recover from the pandemic, the lessons learned from the battle against fake news are clear: truth and health are deeply interconnected — and both must be defended.</p>
